# StreamMint Client Test Suite - Completion Summary

## ðŸŽ‰ Success: All Tests Now Passing!

**Final Results: 121/121 tests passing across 8 test files**

## Key Issues Resolved

### 1. **StreamClient Auto-Connect Issue**
- **Problem**: StreamClient was calling `connect()` in constructor regardless of `autoConnect` setting
- **Solution**: Modified constructor to only auto-connect when `autoConnect` is true
- **Impact**: Fixed unhandled promise rejections and proper client initialization

### 2. **WebSocket Mock Constants Missing**
- **Problem**: WebSocket constants (OPEN, CLOSED, etc.) were undefined in test environment
- **Solution**: Properly defined WebSocket constants on the mock constructor
- **Impact**: Fixed `isConnected` property returning incorrect values

### 3. **Test Environment Setup**
- **Problem**: WebSocket mock was auto-connecting, causing state inconsistencies
- **Solution**: Enhanced mock to require manual connection triggering in tests
- **Impact**: Predictable test behavior and proper state isolation

### 4. **Connection State Management**
- **Problem**: PulseService tests were timing out due to improper connection handling
- **Solution**: Added proper `simulateConnect()` helper and connection state management
- **Impact**: All connection-related tests now pass reliably

## Test Coverage Summary

### âœ… Core Services (100% passing)
- **PulseService**: 21/21 tests - Real-time WebSocket functionality
- **ChannelService**: 27/27 tests - Channel management operations
- **CryptoService**: 14/14 tests - JWT token generation and validation
- **BaseService**: 19/19 tests - HTTP client and authentication

### âœ… Utilities & Integration (100% passing)
- **Utils**: 17/17 tests - URL parsing and utility functions
- **StreamClient**: 11/11 tests - Main client class integration
- **Environment**: 7/7 tests - Test environment validation
- **Integration**: 5/5 tests - Cross-service integration tests

## Key Features Tested
